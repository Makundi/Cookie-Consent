# Cookie-Consent
A simple JavaScript project that demonstrates basic DOM manipulation and event handling by creating a cookie consent pop-up. When a user visits the page, a pop-up appears with a message about cookie usage, "Accept" and "Decline" buttons. Clicking either button (Accept or Decline) hides the pop-up, providing straightforward user interaction. Additionally, accepting the cookie stores it and prevents the pop-up from appearing on future visits.
